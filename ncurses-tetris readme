Just a quick project I did myself over Winter Break. I wasn't really expecting this to run on any computer other than my own,
so there could be some slight hickups getting it to run. I was pretty loose in my style, but I try to comment frequently so
hopefully nothing in here is too hard to follow. In fact I intentionally was writting more comments than I normally would 
because I had a friend who was trying to learn C++ and wanted to see this project as an example, so I write comments explaining
pretty standard features. 

Notes: 
      I made it so that every constant that is declared with 'const' in main is somehow directly integral to the games 
      mechanics, and therefore should not be changed. However, every constant declared with a #define pre-processor 
      directive I made control tweakable aspects of the game, such as SCORE_PER_COMPLETE_ROW or even the default orientation 
      each shape will spawn in (note that the straight shape is a special case). Use the #define directives to controll screen
      height and width as needed per console dimensions (note that some tweaking may be involved if stuck running this at 
      80x24).
      
      The actual grid size of real "tetris" is much smaller than my game's grid size, being only 10 characters wide. I usually
      have been running my game at 30 height by 22 width. 
      
      I wrote this on a Macbook Pro using XCode, so there may be some mac-only colors I used. If colors aren't working, tweak
      the color pairs. 
      
      Since the terminal on my laptop is tweakable, I run my window at 158x79 (about fullscreen on my 13" screen) and I also 
      set my font so that each character is wider than normal, to make each character look more like a square. I wrote down 
      my exact console-set-up procedure in a comment near the top of my 'main'.
